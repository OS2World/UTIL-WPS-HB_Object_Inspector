HB Object Inspector version 0.5.0c
==================================

What is this?
-------------

This is a free clone of Object Inspector, one of the most appreciated parts
of Stardock's Object Desktop. 

NOTE: Although the GUI of the program looks very similar to Stardock's
Object Inspector, they do not have a single line of code in common. This is
a completely new implementation.

It is provided AS IS without any warranty. It is completely your own risk 
to try out this software! You are not allowed to sell this work (as if 
somebody would buy it). You are entitled to use this on every computer you 
own and on those of your friends and wherever you like, as long as no live 
depends on that computer.

What is the difference between SD Object Inspector and HB Object Inspector?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Stardock's Object Inspector is dead like Object desktop. Sigh.
- HB Object Inspector is alive and kicking (although it is kicking slowly).
- HB Object Inspector provides parts of the functionality of SD's OI.
- HB Object Inspector can create WPI packages from folders

What features are currently missing in HB Object Inspector?
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Cannot create .RC scripts
- Cannot create recursive WPI packages/REXX scripts	(only one level, for now!)
- Cannot create REXX scripts for single objects (only folder with its children)
- Cannot inspect templates
- Documentation (another manual, arrrgh!!!)
- Objects cannot be dropped everywhere on the window (try out where and where 
  not)

Which advantages does HB Object Inspector currently have over SD's?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- It can create WPI packages from desktop folders!!! (note, however that 
  only the desktop structure is stored and not the associated files!)
- It is actively maintained!
- It is FREE!!!! 
- No WPS class, but single .EXE file.
- No INI pollution.
- The icon is much nicer!

What do I need to run this?
---------------------------

- The freeware features of DragText installed or
- XWPS
- Henk Kelder's WPTOOLS.DLL.
- VX-REXX runtime VROBJ.DLL.

How do I use this?
------------------

- Drag objects into the title field... (not everywhere else, sorry...)
- All the rest is pretty much like SD's Object Inspector.
- In case you don't have DragText (or even if you have it) it is useful 
  to put a shadow of Object Inpector into the XWPS configuration folder.

What can I expect in the future?
--------------------------------

- All the rest, especially recursive packages/scripts, eventually
  a class editor (although this is no promise!). Some more cool features, 
  tell me!
  
Who did write this thing?
